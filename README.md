# cppGroggyRandom

<p>

Some of my PRNG code in C++ with an example main c++ file. </hr>
The main file, just to run examples from the random number generation. </hr>
This file is not proof of production ready software and is not intended to be used as such. </hr>
It runs, is not pretty, and was made with using the "copy and paste from other parts of the code" method. </hr>

# TODO

<p>

## main.cpp </hr>

I set the perlin function wrong and would hope to display using octaves to create managable noise. </hr>
Along with that, I think it's sorta annoying to have to go in and re-enter a lot of the information. Would be cool </hr>
if I added additional things with that in mind but I really do not want to dedicate too much time to the main file in this project. </hr>
Sometimes it's time to just move on. </hr>

</hr>


## General


I have about a dozen other files I'd like to add to this project. </hr>
This mostly includes a series of noise classes. A perlin noise class is included in this, it works significantly better than the perlin functions I </hr>
created in grng.cpp. I just need to port those classes in from C#. </hr>
 </hr>
Additionally, I need to finish dll related files.
