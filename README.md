# cppGroggyRandom

<p>

Some of my PRNG code in C++ with an example main c++ file. \n
The main file, just to run examples from the random number generation. \n
This file is not proof of production ready software and is not intended to be used as such. \n
It runs, is not pretty, and was made with using the "copy and paste from other parts of the code" method. \n

## main.cpp \n

I set the perlin function wrong and would hope to display using octaves to create managable noise. \n
Along with that, I think it's sorta annoying to have to go in and re-enter a lot of the information. Would be cool \n
if I added additional things with that in mind but I really do not want to dedicate too much time to the main file in this project. \n
Sometimes it's time to just move on. \n

## General


I have about a dozen other files I'd like to add to this project. \n
This mostly includes a series of noise classes. A perlin noise class is included in this, it works significantly better than the perlin functions I \n
created in grng.cpp. I just need to port those classes in from C#. \n
 \n
Additionally, I need to finish the dll files.
